# Fix Summary: Duplicate Declaration and Hyperlink Removal

## Issue Description

### Issue 1: Duplicate Variable Declaration Error
The VBA script had a duplicate variable declaration error:
- Line 10: `Dim PC As String` - used for reading Profit Center data from source
- Line 288: `Dim pc As Variant` - used as loop variable in Summary sheet creation

Since VBA is case-insensitive, `PC` and `pc` are treated as the same variable, causing a compilation error: "Duplicated Declaration Dim pc As Variant"

### Issue 2: Unwanted Hyperlinks
The script was creating hyperlinks in the Summary sheet cells using `Hyperlinks.Add` method. The user requested removal of these hyperlinks and wanted simple cell values instead (with the option to manually add formula references like `=Electricity!B1` if needed).

## Solution

### Fix #1: Rename Loop Variable
Renamed the loop variable from `pc` to `profitCenter` to avoid conflict with the existing `PC` variable:

**Changed (Line 288):**
```vba
Dim profitCenter As Variant
```

**Updated all references in the loop (Lines 292, 297, 338):**
```vba
For Each profitCenter In pcArray
    wsSummary.Cells(summaryRow, 1).Value = profitCenter
    ' ...
    key = glAccount & "|" & profitCenter
    ' ...
Next profitCenter
```

### Fix #2: Remove Hyperlink Creation
Replaced the `AddHyperlinkToCell` function with `AddCellReferenceFormula` that simply sets cell values without creating hyperlinks:

**Old Function:**
```vba
Sub AddHyperlinkToCell(ws As Worksheet, cellRow As Long, cellCol As Long, sheetName As String, displayValue As Variant)
    On Error Resume Next
    ws.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=ws.Cells(cellRow, cellCol), _
        Address:="", _
        SubAddress:="'" & sheetName & "'!A1", _
        TextToDisplay:=displayValue
    On Error GoTo 0
End Sub
```

**New Function:**
```vba
Sub AddCellReferenceFormula(ws As Worksheet, cellRow As Long, cellCol As Long, sheetName As String, displayValue As Variant)
    ' This function sets simple cell values without hyperlinks
    ' The sheetName parameter is kept for API compatibility but not currently used
    ' Users can manually adjust cells to add formula references like =SheetName!B1 as needed
    On Error Resume Next
    ' Remove any existing hyperlink from this specific cell only
    ws.Cells(cellRow, cellCol).Hyperlinks.Delete
    ' Set the value (not a formula) - hyperlinks are removed
    ws.Cells(cellRow, cellCol).Value = displayValue
    On Error GoTo 0
End Sub
```

**Updated all function calls (Lines 319, 324, 332):**
- Changed from `AddHyperlinkToCell` to `AddCellReferenceFormula`
- Updated comment from "Write values with hyperlinks" to "Write values with cell references"

## Impact

### Positive Impacts:
1. **Compilation Error Fixed:** The VBA script will now compile without the duplicate declaration error
2. **No More Hyperlinks:** Summary sheet cells will contain simple values without hyperlinks
3. **Cleaner Output:** Users can manually add formula references as needed without unwanted hyperlinks interfering
4. **Better Code Clarity:** Variable name `profitCenter` is more descriptive than `pc`

### No Breaking Changes:
- Data processing logic remains unchanged
- Summary sheet structure remains the same
- GL account sheets remain unchanged
- All existing functionality preserved

## Files Modified

1. **provision.vba** (multiple lines):
   - Line 288: Changed variable declaration from `pc` to `profitCenter`
   - Lines 292, 297, 338: Updated all references to use `profitCenter`
   - Lines 397-409: Replaced `AddHyperlinkToCell` function with `AddCellReferenceFormula`
   - Lines 316, 319, 324, 332: Updated function calls and comments

## Testing Notes

To verify the fixes:

1. **Compilation Test:**
   - Open the VBA file in Excel VBA Editor
   - Click Debug > Compile VBAProject
   - Verify no compilation errors appear

2. **Runtime Test:**
   - Run the `BuildProvisionReports` macro with test data
   - Verify the Summary sheet is created successfully
   - Check that Summary sheet cells contain values without hyperlinks
   - Verify that clicking on cells does not navigate to other sheets

3. **Data Integrity Test:**
   - Verify all GL account sheets are created correctly
   - Verify Summary sheet contains correct aggregated values
   - Verify Profit Center values are properly displayed in Summary sheet

## User Notes

If you want to create formula references to link Summary sheet cells to GL account sheets, you can:

1. **Manual Approach:** After the macro runs, manually edit cells to add formulas like:
   ```
   =Electricity!B5
   ```
   Where `Electricity` is the GL account sheet name and `B5` is the cell containing the value.

2. **Formula Approach:** The current implementation sets values directly. To automatically create formula references, the script would need to track which row/column each profit center's data is written to in each GL account sheet, which would require significant code changes.

The current implementation removes hyperlinks and provides simple values, allowing you to manually create any references needed.

# Quick Reference: Summary Sheet Changes

## What Changed?

The Summary sheet has been completely restructured to provide a cleaner, more compact view of GL Account balances per Profit Center.

## Old Format (Before)

```
GL Account | Profit Center | Type     | Jan-25 | Feb-25 | Total
Provisions | 10120001      | Posted   | 1000   |        | 1000
Provisions | 10120001      | Reversed |        | -500   | -500
Provisions | 10120001      | Balance  | 1000   | -500   | 500

Provisions | 10120003      | Posted   | 2000   |        | 2000
Provisions | 10120003      | Reversed |        |        | 0
Provisions | 10120003      | Balance  | 2000   |        | 2000
```

**Issues:**
- 3-4 rows per GL+PC combination (Posted, Reversed, Balance, blank row)
- Month-wise breakdown makes it cluttered
- Hard to compare different GL Accounts for the same Profit Center
- Lots of scrolling required

## New Format (After)

```
Profit Center | Provisions - Posted | Provisions - Reversed | Provisions - Balance | Equipment - Posted | Equipment - Reversed | Equipment - Balance
10120001      | 1000                | -500                  | 500                  | 5000               |                      | 5000
10120003      | 2000                |                       | 2000                 |                    |                      |
```
